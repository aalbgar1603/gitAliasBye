# Git Quick Commit and Push

This script provides an enhanced Git alias that allows executing three Git commands in sequence: `git add .`, `git commit -m`, and `git push`. It is designed to be used in situations where you need to quickly commit and push your changes, especially in cases of urgency or emergencies.

## Usage

1. Make sure you are in the desired directory of your Git repository.
2. Execute the following command in your terminal: git bye
3. The script will prompt you to enter a commit message. If you leave it blank, it will automatically generate a message with the current date and time.
4. After each successful command execution, the script will display a message indicating the start of the next command.

## Why use this script?

In certain situations, such as when you need to quickly save your work and push it to the remote repository due to time constraints or emergencies, this script can be a helpful tool. It streamlines the process of adding, committing, and pushing your changes in Git, providing a convenient and efficient solution.

Please note that this script assumes you have Git installed and properly configured on your machine.
